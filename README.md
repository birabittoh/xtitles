# xtitles
A database of known Xbox 360 gamerpics in PNG format.

Credits to [xboxgamer.pics](https://xboxgamer.pics/).

You can browse and search all pictures in [this example frontend](https://birabittoh.github.io/xtitles).

## Titles

This repository provides (and generates) the following files and their minified versions:
* `titles.filtered.json`: only titles that include gamerpics.
* `titles.json`: all titles, including the ones without gamerpics.
* `titles.full.json`: all available info about all titles.

If you're only interested in the gamerpics for each title, you should be fine using [titles.filtered.min.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birabittoh/xtitles/refs/heads/main/titles.filtered.min.json).
